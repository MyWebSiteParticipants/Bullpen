            Bullpen is a <strong>paper-trading</strong> app: real market prices, pretend money. You get a $100,000 practice
            account at Alpaca, a US brokerage, and every order you place here goes to that practice account — nothing can
            ever spend a real cent. The point is to learn how orders, positions and P&amp;L actually behave before risking
            money anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need one thing to start: a free Alpaca paper-trading key pair, pasted into ☰ → Settings. The next section
            walks through it.
