# CHANGES

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Risk limits in Settings** (`src/features/settings/RiskLimitsSection.tsx`,
  ☰ → Tools → Settings): one input per `RiskLimits` field — max per order,
  max per position, max shares per order, daily loss stop, allow short,
  market-open only, blocked symbols — plus *Restore defaults*. Invalid input
  (blank, non-number, negative or zero, fractional shares, an unknown ticker,
  max per order above max per position) is flagged inline and nothing is
  saved until every field is valid. Values persist per device under
  `bullpen.riskLimits.v1`; `src/config/risk.ts` stays the source of defaults.
- `useRiskLimits()` (`src/hooks/useRiskLimits.ts`) returns the effective
  limits (stored over defaults; corrupt stored fields fall back to their
  default). Pure `mergeRiskLimits` / `parseRiskLimitsDraft` are covered by
  `useRiskLimits.test.ts`.
- **The risk guard enforces the limits from Settings** (#13).
  `BrokerContext` builds `OrderPipeline` from `useRiskLimits()` and rebuilds
  it when they change; `OrderPipeline` no longer defaults to the
  `config/risk.ts` constants. The limits live in one shared store
  (`getRiskLimits` / `setRiskLimits` / `subscribeRiskLimits`), so a limit
  saved in Settings reaches the Trade ticket's live preview without a reload
  (and other open tabs via the `storage` event).
- Help → *Placing orders* shows the effective limits (including short
  selling, market-open and blocked symbols when set) and links to
  Settings → Risk limits.

### Tests
- `riskGuard.test.ts`: stored values override defaults field by field; a
  user-tightened `maxOrderNotional` blocks an order the defaults allow (guard
  and `OrderPipeline.preview`); `blockedSymbols` from storage are honoured.
  `useRiskLimits.test.ts`: the shared store notifies subscribers, persists,
  and restore-defaults clears storage.

## 0.7.0 — In-app Help, Discover search, location polish (2026-09-16)

### Added
- **Help** (`src/features/help/HelpPanel.tsx`, ☰ → Tools → *Help & getting
  started*): collapsible sections — what Bullpen is; Alpaca paper keys step
  by step (with an *Open Settings* button); the six screens; Discover;
  placing orders (first draft, reads the live risk limits); fundamentals
  (Finnhub — hosted vs. dev instructions chosen automatically); installing
  on a phone; data sources and limits; glossary; reporting problems.
  Deep-linkable: `openHelp("alpaca")` (`helpEvents.ts`) from the no-keys and
  rejected-keys banners and from Settings.
- **Discover search box** — the ticker/company type-ahead, opening the detail
  panel.
- `src/data/junk.ts` — shared warrant/unit/preferred/SPAC patterns; By location
  gains a "Hide warrants, units & SPAC shells" toggle (on by default, shows
  the hidden count).

### Changed
- By location: region chips and the state/city selects are mutually exclusive;
  both dropdowns alphabetical.
- BETA.md: exact Alpaca signup/paper/key steps; points at in-app Help.

## 0.6.0 — Beta packaging: bring-your-own-keys, relay, Pages (2026-09-15)

### Added
- **Settings screen** (`src/features/settings/SettingsPanel.tsx`, ☰ → Tools →
  Settings · Alpaca keys): paste an Alpaca *paper* key pair, test the
  connection, remove it. Keys live in this browser only
  (`src/config/credentials.ts`, `useCredentials()`), are masked on screen,
  and ride along on every API call as `X-Alpaca-Key-Id` /
  `X-Alpaca-Secret-Key` (`AlpacaAdapter`). The Vite dev proxy honours them
  too, falling back to `.env.local`.
- **Cloudflare Worker relay** (`relay/`): forwards `/api/trading` →
  `paper-api.alpaca.markets` (hard-wired, never live), `/api/data` →
  `data.alpaca.markets`, `/api/fundamentals` → Finnhub with a shared secret.
  Origin allow-list, CORS + preflight, 401 with guidance when no keys are
  sent. `node test.mjs` covers routing, CORS and paper-only. See
  `relay/README.md` for the three-command deploy.
- **BETA.md**: tester guide (Alpaca signup → paste keys → add to home
  screen → what to try → how to report). ☰ → Links → *Report feedback* opens
  a GitHub issue.
- Beta pill next to Paper when built with `VITE_BETA=true`; `env.beta`,
  `env.apiBase`. Menu Status shows where keys come from.

### Changed
- `deploy.yml` passes `VITE_API_BASE` (repo variable = relay URL),
  `VITE_BETA=true` and `FUNDAMENTALS_VIA_API=true`.
- `ErrorBanner` on 401 now points to Settings (hosted) or `.env.local` (dev);
  the "can't reach the API" message no longer mentions a backend that isn't
  built yet.

## 0.5.1 — Main menu, build stamp, Discover layout (2026-09-15)

### Added
- **Hamburger main menu** (`src/components/MainMenu.tsx`), left of the title,
  in the fleet's accordion style: View (the six tabs), Tools (refresh symbol
  list, restore default watchlist — two-tap confirm), Status (paper/live,
  symbol count and age, fundamentals on/off, watchlist size) and Links
  (Alpaca dashboard, GitHub Actions, repository, MyWebSite, Statehouse Home).
- **Build stamp footer** (`src/components/BuildStamp.tsx`): © Costarella
  Innovations, LLC and the build time with time zone, pinned above the bottom
  nav (`--footer-h`).
- `useSymbolIndex().updatedAt`.

### Changed
- **Discover** now leads with the browse chips — Today's movers, By location,
  Index ETFs, Sectors, Magnificent 7, Dow 30, Bonds — and shows one card
  below them, so nothing hides below the fold. The chosen chip is remembered.
  Screener polling only runs while the movers chip is selected.
- Preferred stock and depositary shares are filtered out of the movers screens.

## 0.5.0 — Browse by headquarters location (2026-09-15)

### Added
- **By location** on the Discover tab (`src/features/discover/ByLocation.tsx`):
  browse listed companies by where they're headquartered. Region chips
  (Mahoning Valley, Northeast Ohio, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Cincinnati — by
  3-digit ZIP prefix, `src/config/usStates.ts`) or a State + City picker with
  counts. Rows carry live quotes, open the detail panel, and have the +/✓
  watchlist toggle. Choice is remembered; 30 rows per page.
- **HQ dataset build** (`scripts/build-hq.mjs`, `npm run build:hq`): downloads
  the last four SEC *Financial Statement Data Sets* quarters (business
  address + SIC per filer) and `company_tickers.json`, joins on CIK, and writes
  `public/data/hq.json` (~300 KB, committed). Zero dependencies — includes a
  minimal zip reader. Newest filing wins; `BRK-B` → `BRK.B` to match Alpaca.
  Rebuild quarterly. Until it's run the panel explains how.
- `src/data/hq.ts` loader (static fetch, cached) and `tally()` helper.

### Changed
- Discover's `Row` / `PriceCell` moved to `src/features/discover/rows.tsx`.
- `<select>`s inside `.field-row` no longer overflow the card on phones.

## 0.4.0 — Discover tab (2026-09-15)

### Added
- **Discover tab** (`src/features/discover/Discover.tsx`, new bottom-nav
  entry between Watch and Chart): ways in that don't start from a ticker you
  already know.
  - *Today's movers*: Gainers / Losers / Most active from Alpaca's screener
    (`/v1beta1/screener/stocks/movers` and `/most-actives`), refreshed every
    60s. Warrants, units, rights and sub-$1 names are filtered out client-side
    (40 fetched, 10 shown) so the lists aren't pure penny-stock noise. Most
    active rows also carry live price/change via a snapshot call.
  - *Curated groups* (`src/config/discover.ts`, chips): Index ETFs, the 11
    S&P sector ETFs, Magnificent 7, Dow 30, and bonds/gold/oil/dollar/bitcoin
    ETFs — each with live quotes, a one-line blurb, and "Add all".
  - Every row opens the symbol detail panel; the trailing **+ / ✓** button
    adds or removes the symbol from the watchlist in place.
- Broker layer: `Mover` / `ActiveStock` types, `getMovers()` and
  `getMostActive()` on `BrokerAdapter` / `AlpacaAdapter`.
- `useWatchlist()` hook (`src/features/watchlist/useWatchlist.ts`) — the
  watchlist's localStorage state with `add` / `remove` / `has` / `toggle`,
  shared by the Watch and Discover tabs.

### Changed
- Bottom nav is now six tabs (label font 11px).

## 0.3.0 — Symbol search and company names (2026-09-15)

### Added
- **Symbol type-ahead** (`src/components/SymbolSearch.tsx`): the watchlist
  "Add" box and the Trade ticket's symbol field now search by ticker *or*
  company name as you type ("app" → APP, AAPL, Apple Hospitality…). Pick
  with a tap, ↑/↓ + Enter, or the Add button. Enter never submits the
  enclosing form. Typed tickers are validated against the asset master, so
  a typo shows "isn't a tradable US symbol" instead of a dead watchlist row.
  Until the index has loaded the box falls back to accepting any text.
- **Symbol index** (`src/data/symbolIndex.ts`, `src/app/SymbolIndexContext.tsx`):
  every active, tradable US equity from `GET /v2/assets`, cached in
  IndexedDB (`src/lib/kvStore.ts`) and refreshed in the background once a
  day. `useSymbolIndex()` exposes `search`, `nameOf`, `lookup`, `isUnknown`.
- **Search ranking** (`src/data/symbolSearch.ts`, pure, unit-tested):
  exact symbol → symbol prefix → name word-prefix → name substring; OTC
  listings sort below exchange-listed ones. `tidyName()` strips
  "Common Stock" / "Ordinary Shares" / ADS boilerplate from Alpaca names.
- **Company names** next to the ticker on watchlist rows, the Chart toolbar
  and the Trade ticket label.
- Broker layer: `AssetSummary` type and `listAssets()` on
  `BrokerAdapter` / `AlpacaAdapter`.

## 0.2.0 — Symbol detail panel (2026-09-14)

### Added
- **Symbol detail panel** (`src/features/symbol/SymbolDetail.tsx`): tap any
  watchlist or position row, or the ⓘ button on the Chart and Trade screens.
  Shows identity (name, exchange, asset class, tradable / shortable /
  marginable / fractionable flags), live price, your position if any,
  today's open / high / low / prev close / bid / ask / spread / volume /
  relative volume, 52-week range with position marker, 1W-1M-3M-6M-YTD-1Y
  performance, 20d/60d average volume, fundamentals, and recent news.
  Chart and Trade buttons in the panel bar keep the old flows one tap away.
- **Broker layer**: `AssetInfo` and `NewsItem` types; `getAsset()` and
  `getNews()` on `BrokerAdapter` / `AlpacaAdapter` (`/v2/assets`,
  `/v1beta1/news`); `Quote.open`.
- **Range stats** (`src/features/symbol/stats.ts`, pure, unit-tested):
  52-week high/low/position, performance windows, volume averages from
  daily bars.
- **Optional fundamentals** via Finnhub (`src/data/fundamentals.ts`): set
  `FINNHUB_KEY` in `.env.local` and the dev proxy serves
  `/api/fundamentals` (key injected server-side, never bundled). Market cap,
  P/E, EPS, dividend yield, beta, shares outstanding, IPO date, industry,
  website, logo, next earnings date. Without a key the panel explains how
  to enable it.
- `useAsync` hook (one-shot loader keyed by symbol), `fmtCompact`,
  `fmtAgo`, `fmtDate` formatters.

### Changed
- Watchlist and Account rows now open the detail panel instead of jumping
  straight to the chart.


## 0.1.0 — Milestone 1: manual paper trading (2026-09-13)

Initial scaffold.

### Added
- React 18 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite 5 PWA (`vite-plugin-pwa`, autoUpdate,
  4 MB precache ceiling), dark phone-first UI with bottom navigation.
- **Broker layer**: broker-neutral types (`src/broker/types.ts`),
  `BrokerAdapter` interface, `AlpacaAdapter` (account, clock, positions,
  orders, cancel, submit, snapshots → quotes, paginated bars).
- **Order pipeline**: `OrderPipeline.submit()` is the single path to the
  broker — `riskGuard` (pure) → `journal` (always) → adapter (only if OK).
  `preview()` gives the ticket a live verdict while typing.
- **Risk guard** with configurable limits in `src/config/risk.ts`: max order
  value, max position value per symbol, max qty, daily-loss stop for new buys,
  no shorting, optional require-market-open, blocklist, whole shares only,
  reason required. Unit-tested (`riskGuard.test.ts`).
- **Attribution**: `client_order_id = <source>-<time>-<rand>`; parsed back
  into `Order.source` so the UI tags orders `manual` / `<strategy>` /
  `external`. Unit-tested.
- **Journal** in localStorage with CSV export (UTF-8 BOM, CRLF, RFC-4180).
- **Screens**: Watchlist (add/remove, 15 s polling paused when hidden),
  Chart (lightweight-charts candlesticks + volume, 5m/15m/1h/1D), Trade
  (manual order ticket: market/limit/stop/stop-limit, day/GTC, live guard
  preview, submit disabled until the guard passes), Account (equity, day P&L,
  cash, buying power, market-open pill, positions, open orders with cancel,
  recent orders), Journal.
- Dev-server proxy for `/api/trading` and `/api/data` → Alpaca, injecting
  keys from `.env.local` server-side (no `VITE_` prefix, so keys are never
  bundled). `ALPACA_PAPER=false` switches to live; the header pill turns red.
- Generated app icons (`public/icons`), `.env.example`, README, GitHub Pages
  workflow.

### Notes
- Alpaca's REST API sends no CORS headers, so a deployed static build needs
  the (future) Bullpen backend to serve `/api/*`; until then use `npm run dev`
  / `npm run dev:lan`.
- Verified with `tsc -b && vite build`, `vitest` (12 tests) and a headless
  Chromium smoke run against a mock Alpaca server (watchlist → chart → ticket
  → guard preview → submit → account → journal).
